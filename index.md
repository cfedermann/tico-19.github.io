In response to the on-going crisis, several academic (Carnegie Mellon University, Johns Hopkins University) and industry (Amazon, Appen, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Translated) partners have partnered with the Translators without Borders to prepare COVID-19 materials for a variety of the world's languages to be used by professional translators and for training state-of-the-art Machine Translation (MT) models. The focus is on making emergency and crisis-related content available in as many languages as possible. The collected, curated and translated content across nearly 90 languages will be available to the professional translation as well the MT research community.

To this end, we have so far created:

## Translation Memories for the Translation Community

We have combined the terminologies and other translation data to create translation memories in .tmx format for the majority of the language pairs. 

* Additional details and data download [here](memories.html).


## Translated Terminologies
Translations of covid19-related terms in dozens of languages and locales, provided by Facebook and Google.

* Download all terminologies [here](data/terminologies.zip) (zip file, 0.8MB).
* Complete list and details [here](terminologies.html).


## TICO-19 Translation Benchmark

The benchmark will include 30 documents (3071 sentences, 69.7k words) translated from English into 36 languages:
Amharic, Arabic (Modern Standard), Bengali, Chinese (Simplified), Dari, Dinka, Farsi, French (European), Hausa, Hindi, Indonesian, Kanuri, Khmer (Central), Kinyarwanda, Kurdish Kurmanji, Kurdish Sorani, Lingala, Luganda, Malay, Marathi, Myanmar, Nepali, Nigerian Fulfulde, Nuer, Oromo, Pashto, Portuguese (Brazilian), Russian, Somali, Spanish (Latin American), Swahili, Congolese Swahili, Tagalog, Tamil, Tigrinya, Urdu, Zulu.
