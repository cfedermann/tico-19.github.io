The pandemic is fueled by what the WHO calls an infodemic. People aren’t getting enough reliable, accurate and timely information that they can understand and use to best protect themselves. Everyone needs reliable COVID-19 information in a language and a format that they understand. Responders need to be able to listen to people to understand">

                                    <p>The current pandemic has once again proven the <b>importance of translation</b>, especially in these times marked by uncertainty and misinformation. During any crisis, <b>nothing is more important than fast and accurate communication.</b>
                                    The reality is that official COVID-19 news is only <b>available in a few major languages</b>. But what about the millions of people who don't speak those and who also <b>need information in their native language?</b> How do we reach them? Providing timely translated information to everyone is a huge challenge requiring a joint and concerted effort.
                                    In order to make it possible to translate crisis-related content faster, <a href="https://translatorswithoutborders.org/" target="_blank">Translators without Borders</a>, academic and industry partners have started this initiative.</p>
